# Size Matters in image searching. Based off tested variations applied to reverse image searching.

See the Wiki for the full logic of why this works:
https://github.com/michaelnotadev/Size-Matters/wiki/

NOTE: I am not a good dev and did not create a requirements text or package this properly......but will eventually.

It Creates the files VERY quickly.

The tool will:
1. Open up your file explorer for you.
2. Take any photo, and convert it into 7 different sizes.
3. Ask you if you need a custom size.
4. Open up Google Image search in your default browser for you.
5. Thank you and self terminate the console.
